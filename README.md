# SetList Manager

This is a .NET application written in C# called SetList Manager. SetList Manager allows a band, or multiple bands, to create and customize multiple setlists, meaning a list of songs that they will play at a concert or gig. A band may have multiple setlists because they may want to play different songs or their songs in a different order depending on the gig. A band will be able to create a new set list, customize their old ones, view information about the songs within set list, and track their progress on how well practiced they are at the songs. More features to come.

Progress started on 04/19/2024.
